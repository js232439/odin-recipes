        <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hot Sauce</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cornstarch</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Peanut Oil</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Spices for KFC Inspired Flavor</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>½ Tablespoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>½ Tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>½ Tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon powdered ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon pepper (use white pepper if you have it)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step by Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the cut up chicken in a large bowl. Add the salt, garlic powder, and onion powder, toss to coat the chicken in the spices.</li>
        <li>Add the buttermilk and hot sauce to the bowl, stir until everything is combined. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but it’s best if you can let it sit overnight.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl add the flour, cornstarch, salt and black pepper and whisk this mixture together until completely combined.</li>
        <li>Taking the chicken pieces one at a time, let the excess buttermilk drip off. Coat in the flour mixture, make sure the chicken is well coated. Shake off any excess. Set the chicken aside and let it sit for a few minutes until the coating starts to look a little pasty.</li>
        <li>Fill up a deep fryer with peanut oil (or neutral frying oil of your choice) and preheat to 325°F. (If using a dutch oven or cast iron skillet, I would recommend preheating to 300°F – you may need to turn down the heat if you notice it getting too hot – cast iron holds heat very well so it is easy for it to get too hot so please monitor.) Carefully add the piece of chicken to the deep fryer. Fry until golden brown, turning every few minutes. You will need to fry in batches so you do not overcrowd the fryer.</li>
        <li>Chicken is done when golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Depending on the size of the chicken, dark meat takes about 12-14 minutes and white meat takes 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the chicken is done frying, place it on a paper towel lined sheet tray and immediately sprinkle a little flaked salt on top. Continue with the rest of the chicken pieces.</li>
    </ol>
